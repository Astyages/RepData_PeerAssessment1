### I was unable to figure about how to make viewable the .html and not its source code in GitHub. Thus, I simply used this tool [http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Astyages/RepData_PeerAssessment1/blob/master/PA1_template.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Astyages/RepData_PeerAssessment1/blob/master/PA1_template.html) to view my exact .html file in the browser. If not, the plots will not be visible, despite existing in the .html file.
