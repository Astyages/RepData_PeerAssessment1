## Hello!

### The Markdown file is perfectly viewable.

### However, I was unable to figure about how to make viewable the .html and not its source code in GitHub. Thus, I simply used this tool [http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Astyages/RepData_PeerAssessment1/blob/master/PA1_template.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Astyages/RepData_PeerAssessment1/blob/master/PA1_template.html) to view my exact .html file in the browser. 

### This effort is redundant given both file (.md and .html) show the same output, but I wanted both to be visible.
